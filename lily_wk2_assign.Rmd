```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Background
Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

## Assignment:

```{r}
library(leaflet)

my_map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  
  addMarkers(lat= 51.49774771, lng= -0.2884746988, popup="Gunnersbury Park - Truly beautiful park in London (done on 2022/09/13)")

my_map 

```
